## Overview

This project implements the methods described in the NeurIPS 2023 paper *"Generating Scenarios for Complex Systems"*. The implementation enables users to:

- Reproduce the experiments and results presented in the paper.
- Explore extensions and customizations of the proposed methods.
- Analyze generated scenarios visually and interactively using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Paper Summary

The referenced paper introduces a novel approach to generating scenarios for complex systems by leveraging advanced modeling techniques. Key contributions include:

- A robust framework for scenario generation.
- Methods to ensure diversity and plausibility in generated scenarios.
- Applications in simulation, testing, and decision-making processes.
